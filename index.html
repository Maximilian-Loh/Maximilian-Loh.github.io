      <h3> Robert Frost, Road not taken
          <p> 
          Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
          And sorry I could not travel both <br>
          And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
          And looked down one as far as I could <br>
          To where it bent in the undergrowth; </p>

     <p> Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
         And having perhaps the better claim, <br>
         Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br>
         Though as for that the passing there <br>
         Had worn them really about the same, </p>

     <p> And both that morning equally lay <br>
         In leaves no step had trodden black. <br>
         Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br>
         Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br>
         I doubted if I should ever come back. </p>

     <p> I shall be telling this with a sigh <br>
         Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
         Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— <br>
         I took the one less traveled by, <br> 
         And that has made all the difference.
        </p>

      <h2>A text with higlighted words</h2>
         
        <p>
        <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <em>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.</em>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.</strong>
        </p>
