      <h3> Robert Frost, Road not taken
          <p> 
          Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
          And sorry I could not travel both <br>
          And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
          And looked down one as far as I could <br>
          To where it bent in the undergrowth; </p>

     <p> Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
         And having perhaps the better claim, <br>
         Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br>
         Though as for that the passing there <br>
         Had worn them really about the same, </p>

     <p> And both that morning equally lay <br>
         In leaves no step had trodden black. <br>
         Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br>
         Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br>
         I doubted if I should ever come back. </p>

     <p> I shall be telling this with a sigh <br>
         Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
         Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— <br>
         I took the one less traveled by, <br> 
         And that has made all the difference.
        </p>

      <h2>Highlighting words</h2>
         
        <p>
        <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <em>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.</em>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.</strong>

    <h2>Travel to Singapore</h2>
<p>
   <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong>, officially the Republic of <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong>, is a sovereign island city-state in maritime Southeast Asia. <br>
   It lies north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Straits of Malacca to the west, the Riau Islands to the south, and the South China Sea to the east. <br>
   The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet, the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. <br>
   It has the second greatest population density in the world. The country is home to almost 5.7 million residents, 61% (3.4 million) of whom are <strong class="singapore">Singaporean</strong> citizens.<br>
   There are four official languages of <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong>: English, Malay, Chinese, and Tamil; with English being the lingua franca. <br>
   This reflects in its rich cultural diversity and extensive ethnic cuisine and major festivals. <br>
   Multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution, and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics. <br> 
   Although its history stretches back millennia, modern <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong> was founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles as a trading post of the British Empire. <br>
   In 1867, the colonies in East Asia were reorganised and Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the Straits Settlements. <br>
   During the Second World War, <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong> was occupied by Japan in 1942 but returned to British control as a separate crown colony following Japan's surrender in 1945. <br>
   <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong> gained self-governance in 1959, and in 1963 became part of the new federation of Malaysia, alongside Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak. <br>
   Ideological differences led to <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong> being expelled from the federation two years later, thereby becoming an independent country.

    <p>The <strong>kangaroo</strong> is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning 'large foot'). In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the genus Macropus, red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia, and one genus, the tree-kangaroo, is also found in Papua New Guinea.</p>

    <p>Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development.</p>

    <p>Larger kangaroos have adapted much better than smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the Australian landscape by humans. Many of the smaller species are rare and endangered, whilst the larger kangaroos are relatively plentiful.</p>
    
    
    <h3 id="locomotion">Locomotion</h3>
    
    <p>A Tasmanian forester (eastern grey) kangaroo in motion.
Kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion. The comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about 20–25 km/h (13–16 mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained over short distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for nearly 2 km (1.2 mi). This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water, rather than the need to escape predators. At slow speeds, it employs pentapedal locomotion, using its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs while bringing its hind feet forward. Kangaroos are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if threatened by a predator. If pursued into the water, a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it.</p>

    <h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>
    
    <p>Kangaroos have chambered stomachs similar to those of cattle and sheep. They regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then swallow it again for final digestion. Different species of kangaroos have different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses, whereas some other species (e.g. the red kangaroo) include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi. Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular, usually spending the days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding.</p>

    <p>Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground, and its molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite. The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars move forward as they are ground down, and eventually fall out, replaced by new teeth that grow in the back. This process is known as polyphyodonty and amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees.</p>
