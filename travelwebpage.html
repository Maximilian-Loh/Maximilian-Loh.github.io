    <h2>Travel to Singapore</h2>
<p>
   <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong>, officially the Republic of <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong>, is a sovereign island city-state in maritime Southeast Asia. <br>
   It lies north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Straits of Malacca to the west, the Riau Islands to the south, and the South China Sea to the east. <br>
   The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet, the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. <br>
   It has the second greatest population density in the world. The country is home to almost 5.7 million residents, 61% (3.4 million) of whom are <strong class="singapore">Singaporean</strong> citizens.<br>
   There are four official languages of <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong>: English, Malay, Chinese, and Tamil; with English being the lingua franca. <br>
   This reflects in its rich cultural diversity and extensive ethnic cuisine and major festivals. <br>
   Multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution, and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics. <br> 
   Although its history stretches back millennia, modern <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong> was founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles as a trading post of the British Empire. <br>
   In 1867, the colonies in East Asia were reorganised and Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the Straits Settlements. <br>
   During the Second World War, <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong> was occupied by Japan in 1942 but returned to British control as a separate crown colony following Japan's surrender in 1945. <br>
   <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong> gained self-governance in 1959, and in 1963 became part of the new federation of Malaysia, alongside Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak. <br>
   Ideological differences led to <strong class="singapore">Singapore</strong> being expelled from the federation two years later, thereby becoming an independent country.
